This repo holds my continual work on assignments for a class in applied cryptography.

Homework 1: Decode 5 emails of ciphertext given the types of coding.

Results: 

ciphers.py helped me to get the sum of the letter frequencies as well as the letter counts in each document to decide which text used which cipher. 

I successfully decoded the ciphertext that used Hill 2x2 by brute-forcing the key. This was done in ciphertext.py. 

I came close to decoding the columnar transposition cipher as well as Vigenere.

I did not attempt the Playfair/Substitution ciphers as they involved more analytical ways of attacking the text rather than a code-based solution.

In brief, I gained more experience in Python that I did not previously have and learned a bit more about how to attack problems in a more timely manner.

In the next assignment, I hope to gain a bit more insight from my classmates who have experience in software development in terms of unit testing and other ways to
make my attempts more organized.
